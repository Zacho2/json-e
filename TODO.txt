Immediate next-steps

* finish interpreter
  * parse a single expression and return offset
  * replace pratt parser with whatever other implementations use now
* finish implementing operators
* use an Option-like MaybeValue, or just a custom enum

Tests
* unicode characters containing `$` and even `${`? (not possible?)
* unicode characters right before `${` and `$${`
* unterminated ${
* functions not allowed except in context

Improvements
* avoid unnecessary allocation in checking operator properties
* improve and benchmark interpolate
