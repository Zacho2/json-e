Immediate next-steps

* finish interpreter
* finish implementing operators
    * pass context to operators
* use Fallible instead of Result in interpreter

Improvements
* avoid unnecessary allocation in checking operator properties

Longer-term

* support multiple JSON value backends (notably `json` and `serde_json`)
  either with a trait wrapping both, or by converting to/from those types
