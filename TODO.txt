Immediate next-steps

* finish interpreter
  * [DONE] parse a single expression and return offset
  * [DONE] replace pratt parser with whatever other implementations use now
    * [DONE] missed stuff: array, object literals
    * [DONE] Node::Literal -> Node::True, Node::False, Node::Null
* finish implementing operators
* use an Option-like MaybeValue, or just a custom enum
* [WIP] is_equal needs to recurse.. maybe just build our own JSON type??
* move is_equal and is_truthy into Value (and stringify?)

Tests
* unicode characters containing `$` and even `${`? (not possible?)
* unicode characters right before `${` and `$${`
* unterminated ${
* functions not allowed except in context
* unexpected trailing characters in $eval
* arithemtic with decimal and integer values
* some tests labeled "TypeError" that aren't..
* division by zero

Improvements
* avoid unnecessary allocation in checking operator properties
* improve and benchmark interpolate
