Immediate next-steps

* finish interpreter
  * finish evaluator
  * [DONE] parse a single expression and return offset
  * [DONE] replace pratt parser with whatever other implementations use now
    * [DONE] missed stuff: array, object literals
    * [DONE] Node::Literal -> Node::True, Node::False, Node::Null
* finish implementing operators
* [DONE] use an Option-like MaybeValue, or just a custom enum
* [DONE] is_equal needs to recurse.. maybe just build our own JSON type??
* [DONE] move is_equal and is_truthy into Value (and stringify?)

Tests
* unicode characters containing `$` and even `${`? (not possible?)
* unicode characters right before `${` and `$${`
* unterminated ${
* functions not allowed except in context
* unexpected trailing characters in $eval
* arithemtic with decimal and integer values
* some tests labeled "TypeError" that aren't..
* division by zero
* $let without in
* $let with empty string key
* $sort of very large integers
* index and slice multibyte utf8
* {$$foo, $$bar}
* more fromNow: case, whitespace, ordering, abbreviations, years, months

Misc
* README note that sort sorts by string by default

Improvements
* avoid unnecessary allocation in checking operator properties
* improve and benchmark interpolate
